# Q-Learning with Regression Using Random Forests  

Q-Learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn optimal actions in a given environment by maximizing cumulative rewards. Here's how it works, and how we can apply it to your Bomberman game:  

## Q-Learning Overview  

### Q-Table  

Q-learning typically uses a Q-table where each state-action pair is associated with a value, known as the Q-value. This value represents the expected cumulative reward of taking a particular action from a particular state.  

### Q-Value Update  

The Q-value is updated using the following equation:  

$$  
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a) \right]  
$$  

Where:  

- \( s \): Current state  
- \( a \): Current action  
- \( r \): Reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \)  
- \( s' \): Next state after taking action \( a \)  
- \( $\alpha$ \): Learning rate  
- \( $\gamma$ \): Discount factor  
- \( $\max_{a'}$ Q(s',a') \): The maximum Q-value for the next state

### Action Selection  

The agent selects actions based on the Q-values, often using an ε-greedy policy where it explores random actions with a probability ( $\epsilon $ ) and exploits the best-known action with a probability ( 1 - $\epsilon$ ).  

## Random Forest Regression as a Q-Function Approximator  

Instead of maintaining a Q-table, which can be infeasible for large state-action spaces, we can approximate the Q-values using regression models. Here, we'll use a Random Forest Regressor to estimate Q-values:  

### State Representation  

In Bomberman, the state could be represented as a vector encoding the positions of the player, bombs, coins, crates, walls, and other players. This vector serves as the input to the Random Forest model.  

### Random Forest Regressor  

A Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees that can model complex relationships between state features and Q-values. The Random Forest Regressor will learn to predict the Q-value for each state-action pair.  

### Training  

After each action and state transition, the Q-learning update rule is applied. The training data for the Random Forest is the current state-action pair as input, and the Q-value as the target. Over time, as the agent explores the environment and gathers more data, the Random Forest becomes better at predicting Q-values, enabling the agent to make more informed decisions.  

### Action Selection  

Given a state, the agent uses the trained Random Forest model to predict the Q-value for each possible action. The action with the highest predicted Q-value is selected (with exploration handled by the ε-greedy policy).
